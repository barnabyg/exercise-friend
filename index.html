            <p>The truth? Susan doesn't need another system. She needs someone who understands that her Tuesday looks nothing like her Thursday. Someone who knows that "just 10 minutes" actually works better than an ambitious 45-minute plan. Someone who adjusts when life happens.</p>

          <p>It starts by getting to know you&mdash;not through forms, but through conversation. It learns whether you respond better to cheerleading or gentle accountability.

            <h3>It Starts with a Chat, Not a Form</h3>
            <p>No tedious sign-up forms. Your companion begins by talking to you&mdash;learning about your goals, your schedule, your personality. Voice or text, your choice.</p>
            <p class="step-detail">In just a few minutes, your AI understands whether you're a morning person, how busy your week is, and what kind of support you need.</p>

            <p>Based on your conversation, your AI suggests a companion personality. The Cheerleader Cat? The Focused Fox? The Gentle Bunny? You can accept the match or customize until it feels right.</p>
            <p class="step-detail">Your avatar isn't just a mascot&mdash;it's the personality and tone of every interaction you'll have.</p>

            <h3>Your Companion Shows Up at the Right Time</h3>
            <p>No rigid schedules. Your companion learns when you're actually available and finds the right moment to check in. Lunch break? Just got home? It knows.</p>
            <p class="step-detail">Voice or text, 2 minutes or 10&mdash;your interactions are as flexible as your life.</p>

            <h3>Smooth, Non-Disruptive, Sustainable</h3>
            <p>Every day, your companion adapts. It learns when you need encouragement, when to back off, and when life gets in the way. It's not about perfection&mdash;it's about progress.</p>
            <p class="step-detail">The AI asks qualitative questions, not just yes/no. It understands context, not just completion.</p>

            <h3>You've Built the Habit. Now What?</h3>
            <p>When your AI detects that the habit is sustainable, it celebrates with you. Then, if you're ready, you can explore a new habit&mdash;or even add a second companion for a different area of your life.</p>
            <p class="step-detail">Multiple companions can co-exist, each focused on one thing you're building.</p>

          <div class="creators-note">
            <p>Hi, we're Munish and Barnaby.</p>
            <p>We're not a startup chasing funding, and we're not a corporation launching another productivity tool. We're simply two people who have spent years fascinated by AI, human behavior, and the gap between what technology can do and what actually helps people.</p>
            <p>Over time, we realized something important: lasting change rarely happens alone. The habits that stick are often built with the support of a partner&mdash;someone who understands you, adapts to you, and walks alongside you.</p>
            <p>We believe technology can play that role, but only if it's designed differently.</p>
            <p>Not as a rigid tool, but as a supportive partner.<br>
            Not as something that pushes you, but something that understands you.<br>
            Not as another system demanding your attention, but something that respects your time.</p>
            <p>Most existing tools focus on tracking, optimizing, or nudging&mdash;often driven by metrics, engagement, or incentives that don't fully align with the user's personal growth. The experience can feel transactional, impersonal, and ultimately unsustainable.</p>
            <p>We wanted to create something else. Something that feels personal. Something that adapts to you. Something that feels less like software, and more like a thoughtful presence in your life.</p>
            <p>We're sharing this openly in the hope that it inspires a different kind of AI experience&mdash;one that is human-centered, respectful, and truly helpful.</p>
            <p class="creators-sign">Thanks for being here.<br>&mdash; Munish &amp; Barnaby</p>
