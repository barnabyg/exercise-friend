# Storyboard: AI Habit Companion — 15-Second Concept Video

## Overview

**Duration:** 15 seconds
**Emotional arc:** Frustration → Empathy → Hope
**Structure:** Problem (6s) / Pivot (4s) / Solution (5s)

---

## Frame 1 — "The Familiar Moment" (0–3s)

**Visual:**
Close-up of a phone screen, slightly desaturated. A notification banner slides in: *"🔔 8:00 AM — Time to meditate!"* A thumb swipes it away without hesitation. Another banner drops: *"You're on a 47-day streak! Don't break it."* The phone is placed face-down.

**On-screen text (bottom, small):**
> "Sound familiar?"

**Tone:** Quiet, relatable, slightly grey. No music yet — just a soft ambient sound.

**Transition:** Slow fade to next frame.

---

## Frame 2 — "The Streak Breaks" (3–6s)

**Visual:**
The phone screen, face-up. It shows a broken streak notification: *"Streak lost. 😔 Start again?"* The screen dims. Pull back slightly — we see the person (silhouetted or faceless) sitting slumped at a desk, gym bag by the door untouched.

**On-screen text (centre):**
> "Apps track. They don't understand."

**Tone:** Still subdued, but warm — empathetic, not judgmental. Music fades in softly (calm, understated).

**Transition:** Cut hard to next frame — the visual tone shifts noticeably warmer.

---

## Frame 3 — "A Different Kind of Message" (6–10s)

**Visual:**
The same phone. The screen lights up — but this time it's different. Warmer colours. The Gentle Bunny avatar appears, soft and inviting. A speech bubble reads:

> *"Looks like today was a lot. How about just 5 minutes? No pressure — I'll be here either way."*

The person picks the phone up. Their posture shifts slightly — less slumped.

**On-screen text (top, fading in):**
> "What if your habit app actually knew you?"

**Tone:** Warm, hopeful. Music lifts gently. The screen glow is the brightest, warmest thing in the frame.

**Transition:** Smooth dissolve into next frame.

## Frame 4 — "Meet Your Companions" (10–13s)

**Visual:**
Quick, warm montage — three illustrated companion cards drop or slide into frame like polaroids:

- **Cheerleader Cat** — energetic pose, speech bubble: *"You've got this!"*
- **Focused Fox** — calm, steady gaze, speech bubble: *"Let's keep the plan."*
- **Gentle Bunny** — soft expression, speech bubble: *"No rush. I'm with you."*

Each card appears with a subtle bounce, then all three sit together on screen for a beat.

**On-screen text (below the cards):**
> "Your companion. Your personality. Your pace."

**Tone:** Upbeat, playful-but-warm. The music's most hopeful moment.

**Transition:** Cards sweep aside cleanly into the final frame.

---

## Frame 5 — "The Close" (13–15s)

**Visual:**
Clean, warm background. The three avatars appear small, together, at the bottom. The product name fades in centrally in bold Inter:

> **AI Habit Companion**

Below it, the tagline appears one word at a time:

> *"Not a tracker. A companion."*

A subtle URL or "Learn more ↓" appears at the very bottom (optional).

**Tone:** Calm, confident, memorable. Music resolves to a single held note or soft chord.

## Production Notes

| Element | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Aspect ratio** | 9:16 (social/vertical) with 16:9 crop safe for desktop |
| **Avatar style** | Illustrated — consistent with the warm, rounded style described in the PRD (Headspace/Duolingo reference) |
| **Colour palette** | Opens desaturated (#7F8C8D greys), warms progressively to coral (#FF6B6B) and cream (#FFF8F0) by the close |
| **Typography** | Inter Bold — same as the website |
| **Music** | Soft, minimal piano or acoustic — no beats, nothing that feels like a productivity app ad |
| **Voiceover** | Optional; the story works as text-only for silent autoplay on social media |
| **Duration split** | Problem: 6s / Pivot: 4s / Solution: 5s — classic problem/solution arc |

## The Emotional Thread

The video mirrors the user journey from the PRD (Arrival → Curiosity → Belief) compressed into 15 seconds: the viewer should feel *seen* in frames 1–2, *curious* in frame 3, and *hopeful* in frames 4–5. The companion never shows a product UI — keeping the focus on the *relationship*, not the features.
